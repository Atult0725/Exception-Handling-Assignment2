Additionally, the Exception class includes methods for retrieving the error message, as well as the line number and other information about where the exception was raised.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans--\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Be specific about the exception: Catching a generic exception such as Exception or BaseException can mask bugs and make debugging harder. It's better to catch specific exceptions that you expect to occur in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Use the try-except block sparingly: A try-except block can hide exceptions and make it harder to diagnose problems. Use try-except blocks only around the code that you expect to raise an exception and not the entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Handle exceptions close to the source: If an exception is raised inside a function, it's better to handle it inside the function. This way, you can provide a more specific error message to the user, and the calling code can continue without interruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Don't use exceptions for control flow: Exceptions should be used to handle exceptional cases, not for normal control flow. Using exceptions for control flow can make the code harder to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Always include a message in your exception: When you raise an exception, always include a message that describes what went wrong. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the problem and fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Use context managers for resource cleanup: Context managers such as with statements can automatically clean up resources when they are no longer needed. This can help prevent resource leaks and other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Don't catch exceptions you can't handle: Catching an exception you can't handle can cause more problems than it solves. It's better to let the exception propagate up the call stack to a handler that can handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Test your exception handling code: Exception handling code is just like any other code, and it needs to be tested. Make sure that your exception handling code works as expected and handles all the exceptions it's supposed to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write better, more robust code that is easier to maintain and debug.\n",
